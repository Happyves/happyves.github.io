# Now

I'm a PhD Student working at TU Berlin. TODO : add details
Contact me at jaeckle@zib.de


# So far

I'm from Munich (Germany), where I went to the french-german highschool Lycée Jean Renoir. I then started my higher education studies at the University of Strasbourg, where I completed the MPA (mathématiques et physique approfondie) course. Then, I recieved a Bachelors degree in math at the University of Bonn, where I tutored an analysis class for physicists for a semester, and studied economics as side subject. Finally, I recieved a Masters degree in math at the Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin). There, I was employed as a student help (SHK) at the Zuse Institut (Berlin) for formalising math in Lean in the context of a master thesis.


# Interests

My work revolves arround:
- Formalising math (in Lean 4)
- Automated theorem proving

I also like the following, though I can't spend much time on it:
- Algorithms (data structures, complexity, computational geometry)
- Combinatorics (enumerative, extremal, probabilistic, and I want to read up on algebraic)
- Game theory (combinatorial, positional, applied/economic (?))
- Algorithms in the context of solvers (optimization, scientific computing ("Numerik" in german), algebra)
- AI models and methods (the list is long)


# Some skills

Good to know:
- I speak german and french fluently and I like to think that I speak english fluently.
- I know Python and Lean. 
- I've been "teaching" a sports class at FU Berlin where we play a series of short recreational games from highschool, such as dodgeball.
