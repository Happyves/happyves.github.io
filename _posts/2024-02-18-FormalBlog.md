I'm happy to announce that I'll be working with [Christoph Spiegel](https://christophspiegel.berlin) on a blog about implementing beautiful proofs, in the sense of "[Formal proofs from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK)", in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/). The blog is availble [here](https://thebook.zib.de/).

I implemented a few chapters of the latter source in the context of a Master thesis at FU Berlin, in Lean 3. You can check out the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/Happyves/Master_Thesis), though most of it's content will be ported to Lean 4, polished and improved, and also documented in more detail on the blog.

It'll be great!
