Durring my studies, I wrote some notes about stuff I read. I find this helpful for memorisation and it allows to formulate things in one's own words, providing the level of detail one desires. Needless to say, I did not review these notes. They are incomplete and probably riddled with mistakes. However, I believe that some of their parts may be of use, which is why I'm putting them online here:
- Notes on algorithms and optimization [link](https://happyves.github.io/assets/docs/OptiAlgoBook.pdf)
- Notes on combinatorics [link](https://happyves.github.io/assets/docs/ConversationalCombinatorics.pdf)
- Notes of flag algebras (combinatoris) [link](https://happyves.github.io/assets/docs/FriendlyFlagAlgebras.pdf)
- Notes on finite dynamical systems [link](https://happyves.github.io/assets/docs/FiniDynaSysBook.pdf)
- My submission for 3blue1brown's SoME 1, about spanning surfaces of knots [link](https://happyves.github.io/assets/docs/3b1bexpov2.pdf)
