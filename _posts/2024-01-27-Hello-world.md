Started this new website! I hope to fill it with posts and content soon!

Don't mind the following. I'm just testing stuff.

```lean
def msg := "Hello World!"

#eval IO.println msg
```
Should syntax-highligh Lean 4 code.

\\(\lam x : \sigma, x\\) should be rendered and so should \\(\sum _{i=0} ^42 i\\). Also the following should be in equation-format \\[e = \pi = 3\\] Beatiful, isn't it.
